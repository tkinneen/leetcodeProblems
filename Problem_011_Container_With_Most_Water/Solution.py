# LeetCode Problem 011: Container With Most Water
# You are given an integer array height of length n. There are n vertical
#    lines drawn such that the two endpoints of the ith line are (i, 0) and 
#    (i, height[i]).
# Find two lines that together with the x-axis form a container, such that 
#    the container contains the most water.
# Return the maximum amount of water a container can store.
# Notice that you may not slant the container.

from typing import List

class Solution:
    def maxArea(self, height: List[int]) -> int:

        # Time complexity: O(n) - Memory complexity: O(1) (as we're only using pointers)


        return 0
