# leetcodeProblems

Working through Leetcode's programming interview problems to strengthen my algorithm skills. Focusing on Python for this latest round.

For each solution I've provided a main function that populates the test objects which get passed to the Solution class. This allows you to work in your favorite IDE and pass in your own test cases as opposed to working with the black box IDE provided on Leetcode's website.  Hopefully this helps some noobies :)
