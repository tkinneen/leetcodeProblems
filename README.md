# leetcodeProblems

Working through Leetcode's programming interview problems to strengthen my algorithm skills. Focusing on Python for this latest round.

For each solution I've provided a main function that populates the test objects that get passed to the Solution class. This allows you to work in your favorite IDE as opposed to the one provided on Leetcode's website.  Hopefully this helps some noobies :)
